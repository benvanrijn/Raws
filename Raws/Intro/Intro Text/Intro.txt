This story starts and ends with lights in the darkness.

My father told me it began in an emerald flash in the night sky above the forest outside the town. It was the 16th of December, 1964, the day I was born.

Months passed, and the event was written off as a freak occurrence.

That was until the disappearances.

At first, it was just one person, lost in the woods. Gossip and rumour.

And then it was more, and more. The woods grew and grew, becoming overgrown, and fewer people ventured there.

Word spread of an evil, a force, something that waited in the still trees.

The government led excursions that ended in disaster, whole companies of troops lost amongst the silent forest.

Fearing something they couldn't control, a cordon was established, excluding the curious and the foolish.

But money overrides reason, and slowly men and women penetrated the cordon, searching for artifacts, evidence of the growing darkness.

It was a profession my father warned me against, until the money it brought the first hot meal we had in months, and clothes that fit.

Until one day, he disappeared too, and I spent my days languishing in the bar.
